In Plain Vue: Boston Vue.js Meetup 5/22/17


The elements of this component that we will focus on building today are:
The `<textarea>` where users can enter their tweet
The `<button>` that is enabled/disabled as a function of how long the tweet is
A counter that indicates how many characters (out of 140) remain, and changes color to warn the user of this limit

next steps: add tweet to list using components
